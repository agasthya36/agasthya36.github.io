Hey, I am Vishwas Badiger. One among the millions of software engineers out there.

Have knowlege in working on Python projects. Also interested in topics like Security and System Design and would 
like to learn more about them. I Like to read blogs, want to read books, but end up wasting more time on customising my 
Android phone or my Linux setup. 

I mostly watch movies/tv-series to spend time. Also love to listen to Kannada Cinema music. Dream about writing songs, but ends up appreciating Jayant Kaykini/Yograj Bhat lyrics and giving up on mine.

If you are still interested, please read ahead..
